# Multi-platform (Binance, Bitmaxhelp, Bitforex, Kraken) Automated Monitoring System Using Python & Telegram Integration
This is a showcase project implementing multiple platform monitoring using independent threads and telegram integration with database design and storage

# Library Setup
```bash
pip install requests bs4
```

# Purpose
This was developed to monitor multiple vendors concurrently using Python and multithreading that checks each vendor's website after a fixed delay.<br>
It alerts the end users when there is new news published on each vendor's website and gives an alert on the news link and title of the news.<br>
A dedicated computer/VPS in the cloud is needed for indefinite monitoring.
